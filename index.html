        <h2>hello, i need to be better</h2>
        <p> i honestly don't know what im doing and i need to get my shit together. but i guess im not special for that huh. im tryna better myself because i fucked up majorly, and i dont respect or have any care for myself. i think that i need to understand who i am and what i stand for/like so im making this to organize those thoughts. dont really know what im gonna write about, maybe music, politics, life, food, culture, whatever i guess. maybe this'll serve as a little thing to represent who i am/was. im not expecting anyone but me to read this, i dont really want anyone i know reading this especially. who knows if this'll even last longer than this one addition. </p>
